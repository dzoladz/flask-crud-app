# Building a Flask CRUD Application

Gareth Dwyer's tutorial on [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/building-a-crud-application-with-flask-and-sqlalchemy-dm3wv7yu2) was used as the source to explore the use of a Dockerfile to build a Flask app from a git repo. The resulting image was pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dzoladz/flask-crud-app/).
